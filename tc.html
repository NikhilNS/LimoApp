          <p><strong>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong></p>

<p><strong>Airport Transfer Rates</strong></p>

<p>The Company provides a flat rate for airport pickups and drop-offs servicing most major airports. The Basic Airport Transfer rate is based upon a pickup and drop-off without any associated delay or waiting time exceeding fifteen (15) minutes. Your reserved vehicle is dispatched according to the flight&rsquo;s estimated time of arrival as provided to the Company by each respective airline&rsquo;s automated system (Company is not responsible for any delays caused by the airline&rsquo;s automated system or otherwise). Billing shall revert to the Company&rsquo;s prevailing hourly rate, see below, in the event the Client is delayed, or the waiting<br />
time is exceeded, beyond the allotted fifteen (15) minutes.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cancellation Policy</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;We require a minimum of two (2) hours notice prior to the scheduled pickup time in order to avoid late cancellation charges. Late cancellations are charged at the respective minimum hourly rate &nbsp;and specified vehicle type. If the reservation(s) is cancelled within the required time parameters, it is the Client&rsquo;s responsibility to obtain a cancellation number, given at the time the order is cancelled, in order to avoid late charges.</p>

<p><strong>No Show Charges</strong></p>

<p>If Client is unable to locate Client&rsquo;s Chauffeur for any reason, Client should immediately contact the Company at either 203-000-000, 24 hours a day/ seven days a week. Our Dispatch Offices will be able to locate the Chauffeur immediately and facilitate a meeting point. &ldquo;No Show&rdquo; charges will apply in the event the Client fails to call our office before leaving the scheduled pickup location. This charge also applies if Client fails to cancel the reservation and the Chauffeur is dispatched. No Shows charges are billed at the respective minimums for each market and specified vehicle type.</p>

<p><strong>Service Rates</strong></p>

<p>Rates, terms, &amp; conditions are subject to change without prior notification. Special rates, extended minimums and alternate cancellation policies may apply on special event days.

<p>The time of arrival at starting point, stop-over point, destination or return to point of origin cannot be guaranteed. Travel speed limits are prescribed by law, and Chauffeur is instructed to travel at all times at speeds compatible with safe operation. Road, traffic and weather conditions are beyond the control of the Company and the Chauffer, and no refunds shall be given as a result of<br />
late arrivals due to such conditions or other occurrences out of the control of the Company or the Chauffeur.</p>

<p><strong>Baggage and Other Property Transported</strong></p>

<p><strong>Unusual Cleaning</strong></p>

<p>If, during or after the transportation service, the Company is required to expend a greater than normal amount of time and material clean the vehicle due to acts of the Client, the Company, at its option, may charge Client additional fees to cover such additional time and materials.</p>
